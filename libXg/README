This is an implementation of Plan 9's graphics library
under X using the Xt intrinsics. It should work for
X11 release 3 or higher.

The manual pages graphics.3, balloc.3, bitblt.3, event.3
and rgbpix.3 describe the libg interface, with the following
differences necessary to accommodate X:

- xtbinit is used to initialize the library, instead of
  binit

- getfont is used to read a font by name, instead of
  falloc, ffree, rdfontfile, wrfontfile

- divpt is the name of libg's div (which conflicts with ANSI)

- the event stuff is not optional (or bflush must be
  called every now and then)
